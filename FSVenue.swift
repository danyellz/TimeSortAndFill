         An algorithm to sort visitors and fill in gaps to show
         venue owners where they could improve foot traffic
         
         What we know:
         -------------
         - Time (opening hours / visits) is given as seconds from midnight and converted into 24hr time
         - People are sorted by their entry time and can overlap (so we sort by entry and then by the latter of exit times)
         - Gaps are inserted based on lack of entry time or immediately after someone exits until the next person or closing
         */

        /*
         NOTE: 
         
         - Initially attempted to iterate through venueVisitor in ascending order, but this method doesn't account for
         overlapping throughout the collection, and requires an O(n^2) solution. However, this does prove to work when all
         arriveTimes/leaveTimes in the collection are in ascending order.
         
         - Building a collection of visitors sorted by arriveTime then leaveTime may cause lag if done with a large array
         - Could be improved by sorting by breaking up operations such as sorted arrays
